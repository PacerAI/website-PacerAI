## Quick Start for Claude Code

1. Source env vars: `source ~/.zshrc` — confirms `WP_BASE_URL`, `WP_USER`, `WP_APP_PASSWORD`
2. Read `CLAUDE.md` for page registry and deploy workflows
3. Read `AGENTS.md` for operating instructions and brand constraints
4. Read `docs/deploy/runbook.md` before deploying to WordPress
5. Site tree and build prompts for new pages: `docs/plan/site-tree-and-build-prompts.md`

---

## Deploy Workflow

Each HTML source file is deployed to WordPress as a Page via the REST API:

```python
import requests, os

source ~/.zshrc  # loads WP_BASE_URL, WP_USER, WP_APP_PASSWORD

with open('src/platform/overview.html') as f:
    html = f.read()

content = f"<!-- wp:html -->{html}<!-- /wp:html -->"
resp = requests.post(
    f"{os.environ['WP_BASE_URL']}/wp-json/wp/v2/pages/371",
    json={"content": content},
    auth=(os.environ['WP_USER'], os.environ['WP_APP_PASSWORD'])
)
```

See `docs/deploy/runbook.md` for full instructions including backup, verification, and batch deploys.
