## 1. Primary Messaging & Positioning

### Tagline
**"Your ARR Snowball Report. Automated. Board-Ready."**

### Positioning Statement
Pacer AI is an ARR intelligence platform built for PE-backed B2B SaaS companies ($50M–$1B ARR). It transforms raw revenue data — CRM, billing, and reported — into due diligence-grade ARR Snowball reports, automatically. From raw data to board quality in days, not months.

### Value Proposition Pillars
1. **Speed** — Board-ready ARR reports in days, not months
2. **Automation** — No manual Excel, no data team dependency
3. **Credibility** — Due diligence-grade accuracy, M&A defensible
4. **Microsoft Native** — Built on Fabric, Power BI, Excel + Copilot

### Target Personas

| Persona | Title | Pain Point | Message |
|---------|-------|------------|---------|
| Operating Partner | PE firm (3–15 portfolio cos) | No consistent ARR view across portfolio | "Portfolio-wide ARR intelligence in one platform" |
| CFO / VP Finance | $50M–$500M ARR SaaS | Months to produce board-ready ARR report | "Board-ready in days, not months" |
| Head of RevOps | $50M–$500M ARR SaaS | Data scattered across CRM, billing, spreadsheets | "One customer data cube from all your sources" |
| CRO | Growth-stage SaaS | Can't see expansion/churn drivers clearly | "See where your ARR is growing and leaking" |

### CTA Language
- **Primary:** "Request a Demo", "See a Live ARR Demo"
- **Secondary:** "How It Works", "Talk to a RevOps Expert"
- **Never use:** "Get Started Free", "Sign Up", "Try It Now"

### Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Our Differentiator |
|------------|-------------------|
| Manual Excel | Automated, auditable, always current |
| Mosaic Tech | Microsoft-native (Fabric/Power BI), not another SaaS silo |
| Vena Solutions | Purpose-built for ARR Snowball, not generic FP&A |
| Pigment | Built for PE-backed SaaS operators, not enterprise planning |
| Causal | Board-grade output, not financial modeling tool |
| Cube | Revenue intelligence, not just BI semantic layer |

## 2. How the Site Works

### Architecture
- **CMS:** WordPress.com (hosted, Premium plan)
- **Theme:** Twenty Twenty-Four (WordPress default)
- **Content delivery:** Homepage content is a single `<!-- wp:html -->` Gutenberg block containing inline CSS + HTML + vanilla JS
- **Deploy methods:**
  - WordPress REST API via Python (full content pushes)
  - AI Engine MCP via Claude Code (reads, small edits, media)
- **SEO:** Yoast SEO plugin manages `<head>` meta tags, OG tags, canonical URLs
- **Analytics:** Google Site Kit (Google Analytics + Search Console)
- **Code injection:** Head, Footer and Post Injections plugin + WPCode Lite

### Key Technical Details
- Homepage page ID: **25**
- Homepage slug: `no-title` (known issue — needs review before changing)
- Front page setting: Static page (page_on_front: 25)
- No posts page set (page_for_posts: 0)
- Fonts: DM Sans (body) + Cormorant Garamond (headings) via Google Fonts
- Background: Dark navy (#080E1C)
- All content CSS is inline — no dependency on theme styles

## 6. SEO & AEO Strategy

### Current SEO Status
| Item | Status | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| Yoast SEO plugin | Active (v27.1.1) | Configured |
| Page title (Home) | "Home" | **Needs update:** "Pacer AI — ARR Intelligence for PE-Backed SaaS" |
| Meta description | Missing | **Needs update:** see PRD section 11 |
| Canonical URL | Set by Yoast | OK |
| OG tags | Set by Yoast | OK |
| Sitemap | Generated by Yoast | OK |
| Google Search Console | Via Site Kit | Connected |
| Google Analytics | Via Site Kit | Connected |

### Target Keywords

| Priority | Keyword | Intent | Target Page |
|----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| P1 | ARR Snowball reporting | Informational/Commercial | Homepage, Blog |
| P1 | ARR waterfall analysis | Informational | Blog, Use Case page |
| P1 | SaaS board reporting automation | Commercial | Homepage |
| P2 | PE portfolio reporting | Commercial | Use Case page |
| P2 | revenue intelligence platform | Commercial | Homepage |
| P2 | SaaS due diligence data room | Commercial | Use Case page |
| P3 | net revenue retention analysis | Informational | Blog |
| P3 | customer data cube SaaS | Informational | Blog, Use Case page |

### AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) Strategy
Optimize for AI-powered search (Perplexity, ChatGPT Browse, Google AI Overview):

1. **Structured Q&A content** — each use case page should answer "What is [X]?" and "How does [X] work?" in clear, extractable paragraphs
2. **Schema markup** — Organization + SoftwareApplication JSON-LD (inject via Yoast or Head/Footer Injections)
3. **Definitive statements** — lead paragraphs with clear definitions AI can extract
4. **Comparison pages** — "Pacer AI vs [Competitor]" pages are high-value for AI citation
5. **FAQ schema** on key pages
6. **Blog content** targeting long-tail questions: "How to build an ARR Snowball report", "What goes in a SaaS data room"

### Planned SEO/AEO Agent
Build a Claude Skill that:
- Fetches live page HTML and analyzes heading structure, keyword density, internal linking
- Checks for missing meta descriptions, alt text, schema markup
- Runs Lighthouse SEO audit
- Compares content against target keywords
- Outputs actionable recommendations
- Runs weekly on a schedule

---

## 7. Google Tag Manager & Analytics

### Current Setup
- **Google Site Kit plugin** (v1.173.0) — connects Google Analytics and Search Console
- **Head, Footer and Post Injections plugin** — can inject GTM/custom scripts into `<head>`, `<body>`, `<footer>`
- **WPCode Lite** — alternative code snippet injection

### GTM Implementation Plan

| Tag | Trigger | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| GA4 Page View | All pages | Basic traffic tracking |
| GA4 Event: CTA Click | Click on `.btn-teal`, `.btn-lg` | Track demo request clicks |
| GA4 Event: Nav Dropdown | Hover/click on nav dropdowns | Track interest by section |
| GA4 Event: Blog Read | Scroll > 75% on blog posts | Track content engagement |
| GA4 Event: External Link | Click on calendly.com, app.getpacerai.com | Track conversions |
| LinkedIn Insight Tag | All pages | LinkedIn ad conversion tracking |
| Meta Pixel | All pages (if running Meta ads) | Facebook/Instagram conversion tracking |

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Homepage:** Bounce rate, scroll depth, CTA click rate, time on page
- **Blog:** Pageviews, avg read time, scroll completion, CTA clicks from blog
- **Conversion funnel:** Homepage → Demo CTA click → Calendly booking → Demo completed

## 8. Website Visitor Reporting & Notifications

### Visitor Intelligence Play
Goal: Know who visits the site and what they looked at, even if they don't fill out a form.

| Layer | Tool | What It Captures |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Basic analytics | Google Analytics (via Site Kit) | Traffic, pages, time, referrers, device |
| Company identification | Clearbit Reveal / Leadfeeder / RB2B | Reverse IP → company name, industry, size |
| Session recording | Hotjar / Microsoft Clarity | Heatmaps, scroll maps, session replays |
| Real-time alerts | Slack webhook from GA/Clearbit | "Someone from [Company] viewed your pricing page" |

### Recommended Stack (MVP)
1. **RB2B** (free tier) — identifies companies visiting the site via reverse IP lookup
2. **Microsoft Clarity** (free) — heatmaps and session recordings
3. **Google Analytics 4** (already active via Site Kit) — traffic and events
4. **Slack webhook** — real-time notifications when high-value visitors are detected

### Notification Workflow
```
Visitor hits getpacerai.com
    → GA4 tracks pageview + events
    → RB2B identifies company (if possible)
    → If company matches ICP (PE firm, $50M+ SaaS):
        → Slack alert to #website-leads: "[Company] viewed [Page] at [Time]"
        → Log to CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce)
```

## 9. Lead Generation Capture

### Current Lead Capture Points
| Touchpoint | Current State | Capture Method |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| "Request Demo" CTA | Links to Calendly | Calendly captures email + name at booking |
| "See a Live ARR Demo" CTA | Links to Calendly | Same as above |
| "Talk to a RevOps Expert" CTA | Links to Calendly | Same as above |
| Blog posts | No capture | **Gap — needs email gate or CTA** |
| Resources (guides, templates) | Not built yet | **Planned — gated downloads** |
| Newsletter (Agents of Insight) | Links to Substack (TBD) | Substack captures email |

### Planned Lead Capture Enhancements

#### A. Email Capture on Blog
- **Exit-intent popup** or **inline CTA block** at end of each blog post
- "Get the ARR Snowball Template — free download" → email gate
- Tool: WPForms, ConvertKit, or HubSpot form embedded via WPCode

#### B. Gated Resources
| Resource | Format | Gate Level |
|----------|--------|------------|
| ARR Snowball Template | Excel download | Email required |
| ARR Snowball Guide | PDF | Email required |
| Customer Data Cube Framework | PDF | Email required |
| SaaS Board Reporting Checklist | PDF | Email + company |
| Virtual Data Room Checklist | PDF | Email + company |

#### C. IP-to-Company Enrichment
Even without form fills, capture visitor intelligence:
- RB2B or Clearbit Reveal → company name from IP
- Match against ICP criteria
- Route to CRM for outbound follow-up

#### D. Click-to-Capture Tracking
Track these micro-conversions in GA4:
| Action | Event Name | What It Signals |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Click "Request Demo" | `cta_request_demo` | High intent |
| Click "Log In" | `cta_login` | Existing user |
| Click any use case link | `usecase_click_{name}` | Interest area |
| Click comparison link | `comparison_click_{competitor}` | Evaluation stage |
| Click blog CTA | `blog_cta_click` | Content-to-conversion |
| Download gated resource | `resource_download_{name}` | Lead capture |
| Subscribe to newsletter | `newsletter_subscribe` | Nurture funnel entry |
