**Date:** March 2026 (updated 2026-03-10)
**Owner:** Will Sullivan, Founder — Pacer AI
**Status:** P1 Complete — Ongoing Expansion

---

## Goal

Build and maintain a multi-page marketing website for getpacerai.com that communicates Pacer AI's value proposition to PE-backed SaaS operators and converts visitors into demo requests.

## Problem Statement

The original homepage did not reflect Pacer AI's positioning as a board-level ARR intelligence platform. It lacked the financial-professional aesthetic and specific use case clarity needed to resonate with Operating Partners, CFOs, and RevOps leaders. Beyond the homepage, there were no dedicated pages for solutions, platform details, or company information.

## What Was Done

### P0: Homepage (2026-03-09)
- Full homepage redesign deployed via WordPress REST API
- New hero, ARR Snowball section, platform pillars, use cases, testimonial, CTA
- Removed Beaver Builder; switched to Twenty Twenty-Four with clean CSS overrides
- Added nav/footer HTML, full mobile responsive (hamburger nav, stacked layouts)
- Established REST API deploy workflow

### P1: Site Expansion (2026-03-10)
- Built and deployed 5 new pages to WordPress:
  - **Platform Overview** — architecture diagram, capability pillars, integrations
  - **ARR Snowball Board Reporting** — flagship use case with AEO, FAQ (JSON-LD), dashboard mockup
  - **Customer Data Cube** — 6-dimension grid, use cases, FAQ (JSON-LD), dashboard mockup
  - **About** — mission, founder bio, values, tech partners
  - **Contact** — form, Calendly, email, partnerships sidebar
- Created parent placeholder pages for URL hierarchy (Platform, Solutions, Company)
- Cross-linked all 7 pages (homepage, blog, platform, ARR snowball, customer data cube, about, contact)
- Fixed TT4 page title gap (`.wp-block-post-title, .wp-block-spacer { display: none }`)
- Updated blog page nav/footer with P1 cross-links
- Updated all documentation (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, README.md, architecture, runbook, changelog)
