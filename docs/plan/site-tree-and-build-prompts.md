## Build Prompts

Each prompt below is designed to be given to Claude Code to build the page. The workflow is:
1. Claude Code creates the page HTML in `src/[section]/[slug].html`
2. Review the content
3. Deploy via REST API or MCP `wp_create_post`

### Conventions
- Every page reuses the same `<style>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>` from the homepage
- Extract shared components into `src/shared/nav.html`, `src/shared/footer.html`, `src/shared/base-styles.css`
- Each page has its own unique content section between nav and footer
